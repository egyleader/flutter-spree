## Getting Started

just clone this project and start working ,, no other tricks for now ! 

## Shared Prefrences 

spree app comes with the Shared Prefrences Support by default using a singleton that you 
can use by calling *Prefs.yourMethod(args)* anywhere in your app .

## .env

This is a zero-dependency helper that loads environment variables from a `.env` 
witch is a concept inspired by [the 12factor app](https://12factor.net/config)  and the implementation of [lavravel](https://laravel.com/) 
you can use the .env file with 4 easy steps :

1. rename .env.example to .env file and make sure it is in .gitignore
2. add your env consts to it like this *API_TOKEN=Token* 
3. initialize it as early as you can in your app by *Env.init()* (done for you already ðŸ˜‰)
4. load the env value you want with *Env.load(settingName)*
